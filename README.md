# Star Wars SNA
SNA for Star Wars Episode 4 and 7

Gave a talk for IYKRA x R Ladies Jakarta collaboration (15 April 2021) on the topic of using SNA on Star Wars dataset. I adjusted scripts from the following two:
1. https://rpubs.com/ogimenez/200849 (github Dr. Olivier Gimenez)
2. http://pablobarbera.com/big-data-upf/html/02a-networks-intro-visualization.html   

The dataset for episode 7 was transformed from .pdf to .txt, and it was a bit messy, so needed some cleaning to enable using the script made by Dr. Gimenez. The dataset for episode 4 was also a bit different from the dataset used by Dr. Gimenez, so adjusted as well. R2-D2 and BB-8 originally don't have a specific line when they 'Beeps', but this is their form of conservation, so I edited when they talked. Same applied to Chewie, but interestingly, his line is far less in the 4th movie compared to 7th, so in the end result, his name showed up in the 7th, but not in the 4th. Additional edit using photoshop was also done.

For easeness of viewing, I also adjusted the character list to the ones most popular.
